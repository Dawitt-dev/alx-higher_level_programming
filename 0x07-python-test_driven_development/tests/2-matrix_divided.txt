Importing the function matrix_divided.
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

# 1. Basic division by a positive integer
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

# 2. Basic division by a negative float
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, -1.5)
[[-0.67, -1.33, -2.0], [-2.67, -3.33, -4.0]]

# 3. Division by 1, no change in the matrix
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1)
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

# 4. Division by a boolean, should raise a ZeroDivisionError
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# 5. Division by a string, should raise a TypeError
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, "2")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: div must be a number

# 6. Division by None, should raise a TypeError
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, None)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: div must be a number

# 7. Division with unequal row sizes, should raise a TypeError
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
